# Number-Guessing-Game
This project was prepared for FreeCodeCamp's Relational Database course. See detailed project requirements below.

## Instructions
To complete this project, you need to write a script that generates a random number between 1 and 1000 for users to guess. Create a number_guess database to hold the information suggested in the user stories. Connect to the interactive psql shell with psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres to create the database. In your script, you can create a PSQL variable for querying the database like this: PSQL="psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=<database_name> -t --no-align -c". Your script should only ask for input from the user to get the username and to take guesses. The tests will add users to your database when the script has that ability, feel free to delete those. Some script related user stories may not pass until the script is completely working. Don't forget to commit your work frequently.

## Complete the tasks below

Create a number_guessing_game folder in the project folder for your program

Create number_guess.sh in your number_guessing_game folder and give it executable permissions

Your script should have a shebang at the top of the file that uses #!/bin/bash

Turn the number_guessing_game folder into a git repository

Your git repository should have at least five commits

Your script should randomly generate a number that users have to guess

When you run your script, you should prompt the user for a username with Enter your username:, and take a username as input. Your database should allow usernames that are 22 characters

If that username has been used before, it should print Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses., with <username> being a users name from the database, <games_played> being the total number of games that user has played, and <best_game> being the fewest number of guesses it took that user to win the game

If the username has not been used before, you should print Welcome, <username>! It looks like this is your first time here.

The next line printed should be Guess the secret number between 1 and 1000: and input from the user should be read

Until they guess the secret number, it should print It's lower than that, guess again: if the previous input was higher than the secret number, and It's higher than that, guess again: if the previous input was lower than the secret number. Asking for input each time until they input the secret number.

If anything other than an integer is input as a guess, it should print That is not an integer, guess again:

When the secret number is guessed, your script should print You guessed it in <number_of_guesses> tries. The secret number was <secret_number>. Nice job! and finish running

The message for the first commit should be Initial commit

The rest of the commit messages should start with fix:, feat:, refactor:, chore:, or test:
